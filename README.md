# OpenBudget
An open source Zero Based Budgeting Application. This project has the following goals:
- Provide an open source and cross-platform format for storing a personal budget and performing all calculations and actions related to managing a budget
- Fully offline editing of a budget on multiple devices with a built-in synchronization mechanism
- The user should decide where their data is stored, whether it's on their devices only or on a cloud provider of their preference
